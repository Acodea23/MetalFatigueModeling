# Metal Fatigue Modeling
Created models to predict the impact of various factors on metal's critical failure point

- Predicted metal breakage with 95% accuracy using Linear Model 
- Educated others to implement findings through a presentation, executive summary, and project report
- Determined optimal model through performing diagnostics and analysis on potential models
- Detect factors impacting metal fatigue through design and implementation of 3 variable experiment
